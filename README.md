This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

ðŸ“– This project taught me about:

- Data sorting, filtering
- Responsive Layout without any CSS framework
- Dark/Light Mode
- Server-side rendering
- Deploying with Vercel
- Resources

## Getting Started

First, install all node dependencies:

```bash
npm install
